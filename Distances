# === CONFIGURATION ===
# Path to your Excel file

# The column names in your Excel sheet
lat_column = "Latitude"

# Reference location (e.g., building of interest)

# Distance threshold in kilometers

# === LOAD DATA ===

# === FUNCTION TO COMPUTE DISTANCE ===
def compute_distance(row):

# === COMPUTE DISTANCES ===

# === FILTER NEARBY BUILDINGS ===

# === OUTPUT ===
print(f"Found {len(nearby_df)} buildings within {max_distance_km} km of the reference location.")

# Optional: Save result to a new Excel file
